# markdown-vault Configuration for Obsidian Vault Compatibility
# 
# Use this configuration to connect markdown-vault to your Obsidian vault
# for API access to your notes and vault structure.
#
# Key Features:
# - Works when Obsidian is closed
# - Dedicated API service for automation
# - Can run on servers/containers
# - Obsidian does NOT need to be running
#
# Note: Reads Obsidian's configuration but operates independently
