# markdown-vault Configuration as Drop-in Replacement for Obsidian Plugin
# 
# Use this configuration to REPLACE the Obsidian Local REST API plugin
# with markdown-vault pointing to your existing Obsidian vault.
#
# Key Benefits:
# - Works when Obsidian is closed
# - More reliable than the plugin
# - Can run on servers/containers
# - Obsidian does NOT need to be running
#
# Note: This reads Obsidian's configuration but operates independently
